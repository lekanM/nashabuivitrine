        <p>I realised i could draw from my very young age talking to mysef
             and the figures i create. For me drawing is the only means to express
            every situation, every moment, feelings without offending anyone.
            In the process of applying the material on paper or canvas, I begin
            by drawing in sections stages.

        From as early as he could remember, Nash  Abui has always been an emotional 
        and highly sensitive individual. Inspired, touched and captivated by almost 
        everything in his immediate surroundings. Around the age of 5, Nash vividly 
        remembers having a love and strong fascination for drawing with pen , an 
        instrument that could bring out the details he needed at the  same time bring
         out the Shadows and lights from his subjects.

        He later fell in love with pencils after winning a price  in the year 2017 from 
        a school competition in which he was the the only student not in the visual class.
        Nash now tries all other materials like paint , mud , etc... To see how far his 
        imagination can take him...
        The basis of his creation  is human face or body associated with movement of lines 
        bringing out a kind of balance and harmony .
